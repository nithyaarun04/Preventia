# Preventia
A project created with javascript, HTML, and CSS to help people with dementia to keep their mind fresh and sharp.

## Inspiration
Our inspiration to create Preventia came from seeing our grandparents struggle with dementia. We wished that there was a way to stop it from progressing while 
they were still younger. However, our grandparents didn't have access to great activities for them to do like those that are outlined in the Preventia website. 
So, Preventia was born with hopes to combat against more people getting through dementia and waiting until it's too late to prevent.

## What it does
Although there is no cure for Dementia, especially in the later stages, we believe that we can help those with cognitive troubles at the earlier stages. 
The activities outlined throughout the Preventia website are targetted at those suffering from Dementia (especially early on). The activities are located in 
an accessible place, free of charge and convenient for citizens with Dementia to be able to work to keep their brain sharp from home or on the go.

## How we built it
We used Javascript, CSS, HTML, and java to design the website and it's contents. We also utilized the HackTimer and hammer.js libraries in the construction of 
the rotating facts.

## Challenges we ran into
One big challenge that we ran into was remembering to periodically combine both of our code correctly. Since time was so limited, we worked on different pages 
at different times. So, combining our code and changing the correct things and not losing nuances when combining was a struggle.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Two accomplishments that we're proud of are the functionalities of the activities and the design of the page. Doing all the logic for all the activities, 
and designing the entire webpage from scratch in about 40 hours was not a simple task, however, the outcome of the design and the ways that the activities 
work is fantastic. The website also displays great on smaller screens such as phones. So once the website is published and opened on one's phone, it will be 
usable on the go and not only on a proper computer. We are also proud of the fact scroller that goes through many facts as the design took a while to make, 
with a lot of trial and error.

## What we learned
Throughout the course of the past 40 hours, we learned a lot about different functions in javascript that can be utilized for what we would like. We also 
learned about two new libraries that we can use for timers when creating websites.

## What's next for Preventia
We hope to spend some time on this webpage in the next few weeks, and add even more activities and features. Since the website template is now done, it is 
much easier to add the activities.
